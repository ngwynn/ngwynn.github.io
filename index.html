<div><p>Moon Faces: Completed 9/23/19. Originally started off as a pun (moon faces/moon phases) and kind of evolved. The face is actually text that is randomly generated. For this project I had to learn a lot of new javascript but it'll be helpful in the future.</p>

Met with my kindergartener buddy the other day, so cute! I'm working on something for him, preferably some game. I'm thinking of maybe a fighting game? (little kid friendly of course). Maybe some sort of game where you have to press keys in the right order "attack." Started working on character designs. Not sure if I want characters to be cute or comic style.

It's been a while since my last entry so I'm hoping I'll start adding these more regularly. I'm going to add my spotify playlist that U listen to when I work onto the menu bar, I'm not sure if that's interesting but I mean it's there. I've planned out what all the drawing are going to be so now I'm making detailed sketches/plans for what each "page" is going to look like. I need to work on the actual words, I have ideas for each page but no actual tezt so once I get all of the inital sketches done I'm going to try and work on that before finalizing the drawings.

<p>I've also discovered that the program I'm using to draw (Autodesk sketchbook) allows me to record while I draw. I'm going to start adding some of those videos to this. I also am going to add below an image of the stylus I made.</p>

<div id="stylus" src="stylus.png"></div>	

<p> I made the stylus a couple of weeks ago because I didn't want to go out and buy one. It needs the cotton tip to be slightly wet to function. To make this I first looked up how an Ipad stylus works. The stylus conducts the heat from your hand since it needs the ipad to think you're touching it kind of. Without that it doesn't work, an example being if you've ever been outside and your hands are too cold to use your iphone. From there I just combined two ways to conduct energy metal (tin foil) and water (the slightly damp cotton tip). The tinfoil and the cotton must work for it to function. This could function with just the q-tip and the tin foil but to make it like a stylus and easy to use I took an old dried up ben and took out the insides before putting the q-tip in. It has no pressure sensitivity but was easy to make and works well.</p>
