<div><p>Moon Faces: Completed 9/23/19. Originally started off as a pun (moon faces/moon phases) and kind of evolved. The face is actually text that is randomly generated. For this project I had to learn a lot of new javascript but it'll be helpful in the future.</p>

Met with my kindergartener buddy the other day, so cute! I'm working on something for him, preferably some game. I'm thinking of maybe a fighting game? (little kid friendly of course). Maybe some sort of game where you have to press keys in the right order "attack." Started working on character designs. Not sure if I want characters to be cute or comic style.

</p>

It's been a while since my last entry so I'm hoping I'll start adding these more regularly. I'm going to add my spotify playlist that I listen to when I work onto the menu bar, I'm not sure if that's interesting but I mean it's there. I've planned out what all the drawing are going to be so now I'm making detailed sketches/plans for what each "page" is going to look like. I need to work on the actual words, I have ideas for each page but no actual tezt so once I get all of the inital sketches done I'm going to try and work on that before finalizing the drawings.

I've also discovered that the program I'm using to draw (Autodesk sketchbook) allows me to record while I draw. I'm going to start adding some of those videos to this. I also am going to add below an image of the stylus I made.</p>

<div id="stylus" src="stylus.png"></div>	

<p> I made the stylus a couple of weeks ago because I didn't want to go out and buy one. It needs the cotton tip to be slightly wet to function. To make this I first looked up how an Ipad stylus works. The stylus conducts the heat from your hand since it needs the ipad to think you're touching it kind of. Without that it doesn't work, an example being if you've ever been outside and your hands are too cold to use your iphone. From there I just combined two ways to conduct energy metal (tin foil) and water (the slightly damp cotton tip). The tinfoil and the cotton must work for it to function. This could function with just the q-tip and the tin foil but to make it like a stylus and easy to use I took an old dried up ben and took out the insides before putting the q-tip in. It has no pressure sensitivity but was easy to make and works well.</p>

<h3>11/30/19</h3>
Drawings going well. Figured out how twine works, it has its own weird coding quirks. I'm not sure what to do about the drawings. I think I'll keep most how they are and make some key drawings look really cool


<h3>12/17/19</h3>
<p>
The irony of me saying that I'd make these more frequent. I'm sorry. In other news the sketches for each are done and I'm presenting tomorrow. Yesterday we talked about javascript. It was helpful but luckily I have a lab for tomorrow since I might need help for some smaller websites. We also are going to make present sketches and I'll probably make one for my brother. He really likes pugs, natural disasters, superheroes, and kaijus. I'm thinking of some sort of pug-zilla	that follows your mouse and knocks over buildings. Maybe you can choose where to place buildings? Or they just kind of reappear after a bit? Other little tidbits: changing between different dog-kaijus (corgi kong for example), different "attacks." I don't know something cute and funny though, it doesn't have to be crazy complex. 
</p>

<p>In website news, I'm thiking of adding to the sidebar all my code things so you don't have to scroll through this to find them. I also want to change up how it looks a little bit, clean it up or something.</p>

School week basically over for me! Tired because of a swim meet yesterday (I did super well thank you for asking). Besides the lab I'm going to talk to Molly about a new idea I have. It's not a gift idea/future assignment idea but I think it's cool.

Working on catching up. Pretty far along for swarm, all of the dots move randomly across screen. I just have to work on making them move instead of teleporting and making them disappear. I think I need an event listener
</p>

<p>I also want to revamp my website. It worked in the beginning but it feels cluttered, difficult to navigate, and uninteresting. I'm thinking of updating it functionally and aesthetically. I'm thinking of making it look kinda video-game retro. I don't know how to explain it, think of Bandersnatch.</p>

<p>This was the Fizzbuzz project Katie and I did. This is the final version. We had trouble making it originally because it only worked up to ten so we kept having the entire code repeated before we figured out how to condense it</p>

<h3> (3) 02/04/20 8:44 </h3>
<p>Ideas for presents:<p>
<ul>something related to pugs for my brother </ul>
<ul>a random beach generator - takes data from google maps </ul>
<ul>something related to godzilla for my brother</ul>

<p>Shark book: Still need to tweek some stuff but it's basically done. I think I went a bit ambitious with the amount of drawings but that's fine. I still want to change some to look better than the rest (maybe the title, end card and the one at the aquarium). The whole process was slightly rough because I think I needed to plan my time out better but otherwise I think it looks good.</p>

	Turned my swarm into something interesting, bandersnatch themed with the symbol on top.

<h3>02/08/2020</h3>
<p>About to push this (realized I haven't been doing that) working on joke valentines day card for katie. Original idea not gonna fly so working on coming up with something else funny. Other ideas for revamped website:</p>
<ul>Music themed (half alive, sweater weather, elo, etc.)</ul>
<ul> Hand-drawn (fairy tale book style, museum, doodles, etc.)</ul>

<h3>02/12/2020</h3>
<p>It's my birthday tomorrow! Working on the revamp for this website, going to be bandersnatch/dark retro video game themed. Learned some webkit stuff for it. Ahhh need to work on valentines day card.</p>

For my next projecy I am going to make a "galactic traveler" website. I'll draw something that looks like the inside of a spaceship and when you press a button it'll take you to a random site (will arrays work for this) that has a very cool and weird place in space. For example, a website about Cancri E, an exoplanet made out of diamond.
</p>

<h3>03/6/2020</h3>
<p>
Katie and I are thinking about possibly doing a project together that has a similar feel to umbra. I'd do art for it and it would have a very similar aesthetic but not nearly a story. I don't know.

Just got back from spring break, we are now doing digital dalton. Our assignment thing (reading article and designing clothing item/etc.) relating to surveillance was cool partially becuase I had some prior knowledge but it also gave me new info.

I knew about this because of the hong kong protests and how (once masks became illegal) to avoid facial detection protesters at times used things ranging from contrasting makeup to lasers specifically designed to disarm facial recognition cameras.

<p>I'm including pics of my design (one with explanation). It's a more extreme version of the strategies the hong kong protesters were using.</p>
